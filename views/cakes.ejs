                    <p>Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were
                        modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or
                        elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards,
                        and pies.
